## How to?

- Write p5.js instructions (without space!) in the text area.
- The timeline is the text area itself.
- Special variable assignments of the form `x=a::::::::::::::b` means that variable `x` ranges from `a` to `b` in the corresponding time interval.
- The symbol `|` stops the execution of the previous instruction on that line.
